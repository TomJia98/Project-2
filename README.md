## Description

    junglr is a message-board style app with a twist. To join the jungle you must become a monkey (sign up & log in), how else do you expect to speak to your fellow primates (read, create & comment on posts)? 
    All posts & comments will be encrypted with "monkey-speak" until the user is logged in, where they will become plain English. React to posts with a banana (thumbs up) or bulldozer (thumbs down) or comment on posts to share your monkey-brained thoughts.
